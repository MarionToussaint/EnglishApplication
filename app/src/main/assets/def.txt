to be the best in a competition, game, election, etc…	Eugene O’Neill won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936	Do you think our team will win the World Cup ?	Tony won the lottery and became rich
to turn something round to make a mechanical process operate	My grandfather winds his watch every day	The river wound its way between the hills	I have wound a bandage around my injured arm
to remove money from a bank; to remove something from a place	Richard withdrew $200 from the ATM	The general ordered his troops to withdraw from the battlefield	The participant who cheated was withdrawn from the contest
to put a lot of pressure on something to remove liquids	The maid washed the shirt and wrung it carefully	You looked so mad that I thought you were going to wring his neck	The man was wringing his hands while plotting his revenge
to put words onto paper using a pen or pencil	William Shakespeare wrote plays and sonnets	My sister hasn’t written a letter to granny in ages	Children usually learn to read and write at the age of six
